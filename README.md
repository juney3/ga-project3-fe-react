__General Assembly SF WDI45 - Project 3 - "comic.ly" - Front-End Github Repo__

__Overview__<br>
comic.ly is a MERN (Mongo-Express-React-Node) web app that is designed to help Marvel comics fans find interesting comics and organize them into reading lists. After creating an account, users can create multiple reading lists based on their interests or specific themes. They can also look for Marvel comics by entering a character name and an optional date range to get a list of comics choices to add, based on data provided by the Marvel API. After adding comics, users have a list of comics that they can use to track and manage their reading.
